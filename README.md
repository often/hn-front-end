  # [hn-front-end](https://often.github.io/hn-front-end/)
  yet another HN front-end.
</div>

## why?
I just felt like it.

## about
it's pretty quick and straight forward.

it makes use of [prefers-color-scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) to detect which color scheme you prefer.

oh, and by default top 10 stories are displayed. you may expand that by adding a dummy query parameter at the end of the url.

for instance: [https://often.github.io/hn-front-end/?30](https://often.github.io/hn-front-end/?30) will display top 30 stories.

pretty self explanatory.

hope you like it!
